There are various combinations of removals that have to be considered. We write a recurrence relation to try every possible combination. There will be two possible ways of removal, either we remove the minimum or we remove the maximum. Let(i…j) be the index of elements left after removal of elements. Initially, we start with i=0 and j=n-1 and the number of elements removed is 0 at the beginning. We only remove an element if a[j]-a[i]>k, the two possible ways of removal are (i+1…j) or (i…j-1). The minimum of the two is considered. \n",

If we find that a[j] – a[i[ <=k (means the i to j subarray is valid) we update the length from i to j in a variable to track of max length so far. Else, we update the starting index i with i+1. \n",
