    "<p>Approach : So, we just need to make the sum of array elements even by removing some elements from the array if needed. We can notice that sum of any number of even numbers will always be even. But the sum of odd number of odd numbers is odd. That is, 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 this is odd but 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 which is even. So, we will have to just count the number of odd elements in the array. If the count of odd elements in the array is even then we do not need to remove any element from the array but if the count of odd elements in the array is odd then by removing any one of the odd elements from the array, the sum of the array will become even. </p>"
